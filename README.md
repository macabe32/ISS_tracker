Using https://pypi.org/project/ISS-Info/ we can track the lon/lat location of the ISS using python. The delay is 5 seconds, but can be changed. The map and ISS icon can also be changed to your liking. Just edit the iss.gif and world.png to your choosing. I want to try and link this to the telnet mapscii.me so it can be accessed in your terminal w/o having to open a new window to view. But that is for another day.
